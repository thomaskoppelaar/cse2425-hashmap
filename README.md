# CSE2425 Embedded Software - Hashmap Implementation

This is a simple repository containing an old assignment that was needed for CSE2425 Embedded Software @ TU Delft. Feel free to take a look.

## Usage

Running `make` will run the test cases present in `test.c`. See the `Makefile` for more options.


## Quick Overview


- `gest-run.h, gest.c, gest.h`

Test suite. Given by the lecturer.

- `solution.c`

My own implementation of a hashmap using a list of buckets.

- `test.c`

Place for user-written tests.
